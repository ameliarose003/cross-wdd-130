            The Scone

        </h2>
        <p>
            Spiraling into a nightmare of my past...

        </p>
        <p>
            Running. I was trying to be silent, but I knew I needed to hurry, so I ran faster.



        </p>
        <p>
            Ma’s frail, sick body lay under both of the blankets our family owned. Soralee, my youngest sister, had smuggled onto the small fraying cushion that we used as a bed, clutching Ma for warmth. 


        </p>
        <p>
            Remembering their images spurred my quaking limbs onward. I fisted my callused hands and clenched my jaw as the roads switched from well-packed dirt to cold, hard stone. The months of autumn were upon us and so was the frost. The worn leather boots I had been using three months ago had started feeling too tight, and my brother had been without shoes for at least two months, so I gave him mine. My well-meaning act was not paying me back as much as I had hoped. I felt the shock of cold every time my feet met with the stone street.


        </p>
        <p>
            Life had quickly gone from unfair to well-beyond-destitute in the last three weeks. Our master had gone into another of his fits of rage when one of my siblings had been caught stealing from the elegant dishes that had been prepared exclusively for his wealthy guests. When he discovered that Ma had not completed all of her tasks because she was ill, he kicked us out with barely a warning. The room we had shared in the Onney Manor servants’ quarters was one of the only homes my family had known.


        </p>
        <p>
            Though my brave mother was understanding and meek, she knew that we would not survive the winter in the streets, so she searched for a new job. She and I had been able to work at an Inn for four days before Ma’s condition worsened. It scared me how she could go from confident, happy Ma to a weak, timid Ma. I had rushed back from work today to discover that someone or something had stolen the last of our food. It was enough to make me brave the streets once more in search of something, anything even. We only had enough for one meal per day as it was, from my scarce wages.


        </p>
        <p>
            How long had I been running? It felt like forever. My toes had gone numb already and my fingers felt like they were mechanical icicles. Nevertheless, I pressed on. I had watched Ma sacrifice everything for us, and I knew it was my responsibility to care for her. She had asked for a crust of bread and some rootsdrink tea. I would do even better than that, I would find her a scone and maybe even some real tea.


        </p>
        <p>
            Growls and barking of large dogs echoed from the deserted streets and caught me off-guard. I tripped on a stone, sliding and skinning my elbows and knees. I barely felt it with the nipping cold of the stone road beneath me.


        </p>
        <p>
            All I wanted was to hurry back to Ma and cuddle in our blankets with my family.


        </p>
        <p>
            I had almost reached the center of the city now; where was I going? I had no idea, but I knew my way back. My skills in finding my way around town had been sharpened in the last two years. Ever since I turned fifteen, my masters had begun giving me messenger jobs around the city. That was what helped Ma and I find work.


        </p>
        <p>
            A huge building loomed above the fog and dimly-lit street lamps. The palace. It was the most wondrous building to behold in the brilliance of day, but in the midst of the sleeping hours of night, it seemed dark and mocking. It reminded me of all my past masters and their scornful pride. They knew they were wealthy and showed it off, proudly. I was a dirt rug beneath their feet.


        </p>
        <p>
            A small beam of light caught my attention, and I moved into the shadows to discover its source. A door into the servants entry had been left ajar. I tiptoed closer, wondering if I dare search for food there of all places. I had never dreamed of having an opportunity to enter the royal palace, but my hope didn’t want to retreat to the hopeless, lonely streets. The warmth that spilled from the small space between the door and the frame was too inviting to resist. My feet made up my decision before I had time to consult with my head.


        </p>
        <p>
            I slipped through the door and stowed into the shadows. It was one place I knew I belonged, and a place I was fine with sticking to. I wasn’t scared of the dark, it was friendly and quiet; it didn’t yell at you like people did and cared little if you were awake or asleep. The shadows were my friends; they allowed me to be in a crowd of people or a corner of a castle, without being detected.


        </p>
        <p>
            Making my way from shadow to shadow, I followed my nose through the large halls of the palace. It was strangely quiet, and I didn’t see guards or servants in any of the halls I made my way through. It was like being in a city that you knew had dozens and maybe even hundreds of people living in, yet seeing no one.


        </p>
        <p>
            I heard some voices, and secured myself behind a large potted plant. Six maids, two servants, and three soldiers chatted in merrily soft, dull tones. Their elegant speech and fine clothes were enough to make me imagine what Ma would look like if she wore something like that. She hadn’t had clothing as nice as that for years. She had given me the last nice dress she had, and it was getting very close to rags, especially in comparison to their spotless, wrinkle-less, layered maid attire. They all matched with pale blue dresses and white aprons, while the two servant girls, who could have been closer to my age, wore dark grey dresses and white aprons.


        </p>
        <p>
            Life just wasn’t fair for some of us, I thought with longing. I moved through the halls again, once the group had disappeared from view and their voices had left my hearing.


        </p>
        <p>
            The smell of food was stronger in the next hall, and my mouth watered with anticipation. I hadn’t eaten in a day and a half, except for a rare morsel left in one of the rooms I was cleaning today. It had been a blessing from the Fara and was likely the only thing that had given me enough strength to reach this part of the city by foot.


        </p>
        <p>
            Though it was quiet, I was cautious when I approached the large rounded doorway of what must be the kitchens. As soon as I was sure no one was left in the room, I emerged from my shadow.


        </p>
        <p>
            The kitchen was enormous, with a dozen ovens and just as many sinks. At least eight long working tables filled the center of the room and that didn’t count the counter space that lined three of the walls. There were cupboards and crates of food everywhere I looked, but I was instantly drawn to the scones that rested on cooling racks on the closest table to the ovens.


        </p>
        <p>
            Not able to keep to the only shadow of the kitchen any longer, I rushed upon the table and grabbed the perfectly folded and arranged scone. A bright red, glazed fruit sat in the center, with some crushed nuts sprinkled around it. I had never seen anything so beautiful.


        </p>
        <p>
            I brought it to my mouth and bit into the toasted outside while the rest of it seemed to melt into my mouth. It burned my tongue and brought a tear to the corner of my eyes, but I was too fatigued with hunger to care. This was easily the most incredible thing in the whole land of Shoresa. I knew it. And I knew my mother would love it.


        </p>
        <p>
            I found myself placing five of the delicate scones into my bag. My whole family would have the best meal of their entire life. As long as this didn’t end up being a dream.


        </p>
        <p>
            Casting a final admiring glance over the rest of the marvelous sweet scones, I turned to leave. A shadow that hadn’t been there before, was on the ground in front of me. 


        </p>
        <p>
            I followed the shadow to its source and found myself face to face with the queen!


        </p>
        <p>
            The queen stood in the doorway, hands clasped in front of her, and large mesmerizing eyes full of curiosity. Her rose-colored lips held the tilt of someone who enjoyed smiling. The reason I had thought it was a new shadow was definitely because of the large, ruffled dress. It was a royal blue which suited her majesty, causing her silvery eyes to take on a blue tint as well.


        </p>
        <p>
            Realizing I had been caught stealing, and uncertain how to undo the damage I had already done, I dropped to my knees in front of her. I winced and recalled the fall I had taken earlier. I bowed my head, knowing how inappropriate I had been to meet her gaze head on. Nobility hated it when servants met their eyes. Apparently it was an honor to look at someone when they spoke.


        </p>
        <p>
            I wasn’t sure whether to beg for forgiveness or wait until I was permitted to speak. There were too many rules to keep track of. I relented to err on the side of safety, to wait to speak until spoken to. Bracing myself was a better term for my current action. I waited for the scolding, for the call that would wake the palace and send the guards after me. My hopes of bringing food to my family were shattered with the arrival of the queen.


        </p>
        <p>
            “Who are you, little one?” The queen asked in a melodic voice.


        </p>
        <p>
            “My name is--” My voice was hoarse and trembled; the complete opposite of the breathtaking lullabye of the queen’s voice. I coughed and wiped my mouth on my sleeve. I felt the sticky crumbs from the scone I had devoured stick onto my shoulder.


        </p>
        <p>
            I heard the running water from a sink though I had not heard her move past me. She was more silent than me? That had to be the only way she had figured out I was in here.


        </p>
        <p>
            A soft, pale hand with painted nails set the cup in front of my bowed head. Was she giving me water? Was this a test? Would she accuse me of stealing water, too? I didn’t move.


        </p>
        <p>
            “If you are thirsty, please help yourself. I won’t force you to drink water.” The woman said with a confused tone. This was definitely a dream. Why else would a beautiful noble give me a glass of water, except to signify that I was dying of thirst during my sleep.


        </p>
        <p>
            I drank the water anyway. If this was a dream, I had more chances of survival than in my reality. The cup was soon emptied and I had the strangest feeling in my stomach: I was full.


        </p>
        <p>
            “Is that better?” The queen asked me.


        </p>
        <p>
            “Yes, royal highness. Thank you much.” I replied. I tried to remember the way that the nobles talked to each other. I had practiced mimicking their tones and accents to help me get a better job, but all of that had fled me with my anxiety of being in the presence of nobility.


        </p>
        <p>
            She laughed softly, “I’m not a royal highness. My name is Saralyn.”


        </p>
        <p>
            I had to work hard to keep myself from lifting my head. Just because she wasn’t the queen didn’t mean she wasn’t a noble-born lady.


        </p>
        <p>
            I heard the rustling from layers of fabric and saw the hem of her gown. She sank to the floor right in front of me, kneeling so we were closer to the same height. My assumptions wavered. Who was this lady?


        </p>
        <p>
            “Are you injured? I prefer to see the face of those that I am talking to, especially those who have such a determined energy about them.”


        </p>
        <p>
            A determined energy?


        </p>
        <p>
            Biting my lip, I lifted my head. I stared at her gem-filled necklace. It was a beautiful piece of jewelry that many of my masters would never be able to afford. Whoever this lady was, she definitely lived in the castle.


        </p>
        <p>
            “You are worried about someone.” The lady stated.


        </p>
        <p>
            My shock caused me to meet her gaze, and I found myself once again mesmerized by their silvery luminescence. She smiled victoriously.


        </p>
        <p>
            “Ah. There you are. You are an interesting child.”


        </p>
        <p>
            I couldn’t understand what she meant, but it appeared to have been her goal for me to look at her; face to face. Why?


        </p>
        <p>
            Her wise eyes tried to convey something to me that I couldn’t understand. At length, she spoke again, “There are better jobs than stealing, little one.”


        </p>
        <p>
            “I have a job, my lady...” I sat up straighter. “I am not making enough to provide for my family.” I stated boldly.


        </p>
        <p>
            Her expression turned thoughtful, “I see.”


        </p>
        <p>
            She nibbled on part of her lip, giving her a younger appearance than I had first assumed. It was an action I could never have imagined a lady to do. And yet she had.


        </p>
        <p>
            “And you are providing for a family? When only a child, yourself? Where are your parents?” She asked in hushed tones.


        </p>
        <p>
            “I am close to sixteen, my lady.” I explained, “Ma is too ill to work, so I’ve been cleaning rooms at the Ridgefront Inn. Someone ran off with the only food we had, so I obliged myself to find more...”


        </p>
        <p>
            I looked down again, but thought better of it, and returned her gaze. “I’m so sorry for taking what isn’t mine.”


        </p>
        <p>
            I felt terrible. Ma had always taught us to not steal. That was one of the reasons we were so hungry; we still followed her instructions. I was suddenly regretful to find myself doing something she would be displeased about.


        </p>
        <p>
            “Hmm... I would suggest finding a better job then.” She mused, though she spoke more to herself than anything else.


        </p>
        <p>
            Her face brightened as she smiled suddenly, and I wondered if her smile was charmed to fill a room with light. I had not witnessed people using magic, except from the shadows of an estate I had served in.


        </p>
        <p>
            “Do you think you are strong enough to work here?” Her question came from nowhere.


        </p>
        <p>
            “What?” Was all I could muster.
