Their goals instantly clash as Arielle wishes to go home to the humanworld, and Tyrian is on an important quest to bring the elf princess to Varkylrion for training in magic and combat. Count Tyrian, having compassion on terrified Arielle, who is inevitably trapped in Shoresa, agrees to help get discovery more about her not-so-human heritage.
            With a dark, foreboding force at their heels, and Arielle discovering magical abilities of her own, Tyrian has to decide between two immense options. Should he complete the quest he set out on, or should he follow the quest his heart yearns for? Book One in Warriors of Shoresa Series is sure to be an adventure you won't soon forget.        </p>

            This miniseries of stories is focused on the Cousins of Shoresa. You will gain an insight as to their origins and why they are the way they are. As their stories progress, I hope you will be able to see their strengths and weaknesses in a gentle, compassionate way (as well as for the people around you). Everyone goes through hard things like pain and loss-- some more than others-- but it will affect some people differently. I hope you take heart with the knowledge that they have already gone through this stuff and be excited to see them continue to develop along in the other books throughout the series.

        </p>

            Lexylia is the first Cousin of Shoresa to have her own novelette released. Though we meet Lexylia in Forgotten Identity, her story goes back to her origins, in a childhood she keeps locked away in her memories. If it has a dreamlike quality, it is because that is how memories are; sometimes they fade in moments and are vibrant, serious, and stark in others. Enjoy the moments of Lexylia's past...
