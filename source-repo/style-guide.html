            <h2>Fonts</h2>
            <p>
                I have chosen to use the following fonts for my site:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    font-family: 'Crimson Text', serif;                </li>
              
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Elevator Pitch</h2>
            <p>
                Books are necessary. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Childhood, teenage years, adulthood, and the old age of not being able to do what once you could do before. What holds hope, what holds light, what holds the same excitement through the years that it once did?
                The answers are vague and often unclear. There are few that remain the same. Stories. Books. Words. They hold the same magic through the years. Power and magic that can uplift, destroy, empower, create worlds, and cause even the strongest to cry. 
                Yes, we need stories, for there are things unseen that these words can heal.
                Imagine the freedom to be as strong, rich, powerful, and capable as you ever dreamed. Imagine being able to live out your dreams without fear of death or disappointment. Stories are bought at a small price and have given much to mortals since the beginning.
                When opening a book, you can become something, you can fall in love, go on quests near and far, and then reach your humble destination and your own happily ever after. 
            </p>
            <p>    
                I write stories to heal, free the bored and captive, and to bring others closer to their own personal truths. Truths, once found, that can allow them to forget their fears and dare to hope.
                Belief in oneself is a power thing; one that I believe has been long understated and misunderstood.
                Arrogance has no place within, but confidence causes soul-filled beauty to thrive.
            </p>

            <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
            <p>
                There are many goals that go with the creation of this website. The overarching goals are to build a fanbase, inform readers of upcoming books and projects, direct aspiring writers through the writing process, keep readers interested with bonus material, and formally introduce the author. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This website is necessary to provide a central location for the fans of the writer to find more books and associated bonus material. It will efficiently get them excited for upcoming books and inspire them to reread the past ones in preparation for the new releases. By consistently updating the website monthly, it will keep readers cycling back, checking in, and keeping them connected to the stories and characters. Aspiring writers who admire the works of this author will gain greater insights on the current writing process. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Audience Statement</h2>
            <p>
                There is a wide variety of people who would visit this website: Adults (18+) and Teens (12-17). The adults who would go to this website are likely to be of all financial situations; they are people who love reading, buying books, or in need of a gift. It is more than likely that these will be people who enjoy fantasy or at least escaping from the mundane. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Most teens fall into similar categories: required to read for school, love adventures, have rough school days, or need encouragement and examples of bravery. They probably don’t have much money, but the price of a book is worth their venture; and if not, the free bonus material will keep them coming back for more. 
            </p>

            <h2>Misson Statement</h2>
            <p>
                I am an Author. My mission is to fill people’s lives with hope, love, light, and belonging. The words will be motivation to help them foster the desire to become something more than they would have otherwise. They will reach inward and find the courage to become more of themselves and less of what the world pressures them to be. I use symbolism, poems, and other devices to explore fears, hopes, and dreams. I believe that when we face our fears and get past the darkness in our souls then we can begin to find ourselves; being vulnerable with oneself helps to build character anew. As a protector of the weak and strengthener of the strong, the characters in my stories will bring positive influence and light to the soul who is seeking it.            </p>
