            Arielle
        </h4>
        <p>
            I gasped as I stumbled over Alana’s purple sleeping bag that hadn’t been taken to the van yet. Little sisters were such a pain sometimes. Alana was almost twelve years old and more than capable of taking her own things out.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Alana, you’re not leaving the house unless your hair is brushed.” I heard Mom scold my sister in the other room and smiled to myself.


        </p>
        <p>
            I heaved the two sleeping bags through the front door and managed to reach the gold minivan without dropping them or the book I kept tucked under my arm.

        </p>
        <p>
            “How’s my princess this morning?” Dad asked, reaching for the sleeping bags. He had a way with packing the van so that everything fit, likely acquired from his teen years of playing tetris.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I’d be better if I didn’t have to wear this hideous sweater.” I said as innocently as possible, to avoid cringing. The salmon-colored sweater could have won me the ugly-sweater award over the holidays, but it was summer break, and I was overall disgusted. I was bringing my hoodie to wear over top, so the sweater wouldn’t stand out like the terrible mix between mustard-yellow and peachy-orange.


        </p>
        <p>
            “Aunt Linda just wanted to see you in it. You don’t have to wear it the whole time. It was thoughtful of her to give it to you for your birthday last year. And you look great in it. Why haven’t you tried it on sooner?” Dad asked as he appraised it encouragingly.


        </p>
        <p>
            “Alana would have liked it, Dad. I’m seventeen, not six.” Though I knew she was eleven.


        </p>
        <p>
            Dad pulled me in for a hug, “It’ll be okay, Arielle. We’ll be back home before you know it. We only get together with the cousins once a year; we’ll all make it through this.”


        </p>
        <p>
            He lowered his voice to a whisper after letting me go, “What do you think about a daddy-daughter date after we get back, before your senior year starts?”


        </p>
        <p>
            My smile could hardly contain my excitement. Last year, Dad had taken Jack out for his father-son outing and they went to a baseball game and dinner. He had promised to do something special with me when I entered my senior year of high school. I was hoping to see a broadway musical.


        </p>
        <p>
            A thought flew through my mind, and my smile faltered.


        </p>
        <p>
            “No sisters, right?” I tried to keep the pleading tone from my voice. Lately, Alana had been trying to do everything I did, and it would be a letdown if she tagged along.


        </p>
        <p>
            “She’ll get her turn. This is your big year. You get to decide what you want to do with your life, who you want to become, how you’ll change the world.”


        </p>
        <p>
            I snorted. “Not everyone can change the world, Dad. I’m just glad to finally get out of high school after next year.”


        </p>
        <p>
            He shrugged. “You never know. One day you could become the President of the United States.”


        </p>
        <p>
            Facepalming, yet laughing, I shook my head. “I’m more likely to be a magical princess. I’m going to see if Mom needs any more help before we have to go.”


        </p>
        <p>
            “Sounds like a plan. Hey, if you see Jack, tell him that if he’s going to bring that guitar of his, he better bring it out right away.”

 
        </p>
        <p>
            “I will.” I replied.


        </p>
        <p>
            Walking back into the house, I tripped over Jack’s duffel bag and almost landed on a soccer ball. “Jack!” I huffed exasperatedly.


        </p>
        <p>
            “Yeah, I know. I’m getting it.” My eighteen-year-old brother replied distractedly.


        </p>
        <p>
            He offered me a hand, though he was struggling with two paper bags full of snacks. After helping me off the floor, he slung his guitar strap over his shoulder then grabbed the duffel bag and the ball. Barely squeezing through the door, he glanced back at me and twitched his eyebrows up and down victoriously.


        </p>
        <p>
            Mom was sitting on the couch, tugging a brush through the knots in Alana’s hair. Alana hugged her knees and scowled with watery eyes at anything and everything in her path.


        </p>
        <p>
            I felt bad for her. Unfortunately, I knew how she felt. I had also gone through the stage where I didn’t like brushing my own hair and didn’t care much about personal hygiene in general.


        </p>
        <p>
            Leaning against the counter, I opened my book. I tapped my nose with my bookmark and ate the words as fast as my eyes would allow. Magical lands swirled through my mind where a princess decided she didn’t want to be a damsel in distress. I smiled in anticipation. Even though I had read the book over a dozen times since my eighth birthday when I received it, it had remained my go-to book.


        </p>
        <p>
            Alana stomped down the hall with a dutch braid in her hair.


        </p>
        <p>
            I peeked over my book at Mom as she started transferring food from the counter to a cooler. She glanced over at me and tilted her head to one side with disapproval. 


        </p>
        <p>
            “Shoes, yes. Book, no.”


        </p>
        <p>
            I slipped the bookmark into the pages. “How about both?” I asked, hopeful.


        </p>
        <p>
            “You can't always escape into another world whenever it's convenient for you. You need to face your problems. It'll help you grow." Mom's advice was repetitive of a problem I had been inflicted with for years, according to her.


        </p>
        <p>
            Though I didn’t agree with her sentiments, I obeyed after recalling how terrible campfire smell could taint a book. I regretfully put my favorite book on the couch.


        </p>
        <p>
            I returned to the counter separating the kitchen from the living room, eyeing my mother. “Do I have to play games with the cousins this year? Why can't I hangout with the adults instead? Like Jack.”


        </p>
        <p>
            “You haven't graduated yet, Arielle. You should enjoy the time you have here. When you grow up, everything is different; you'll find yourself wishing you could still play games with the kids.”


        </p>
        <p>
            “But Mom, I'm terrible at hide and seek. Everyone seems to know where I am.”


        </p>
        <p>
            Mom packed the fruit into the cooler. “Why don’t you suggest hide-and-seek freeze-tag then?”


        </p>
        <p>
            I pulled a face of disgust. “The last time we played it, I had to stay where I was tagged for almost an hour before Jack could find and unfreeze me.”


        </p>
        <p>
            “Who managed to get into track this year?” Mom asked.


        </p>
        <p>
            Barely, I thought to myself.


        </p>
        <p>
            “You're not as young as you were before. And it's just a game with your cousins. If you've been spotted, you can easily outrun them. Have a little faith in yourself, sweetheart.”


        </p>
        <p>
            Dad returned to the house at that moment, announcing that we were set to go.


        </p>
        <p>
            As much as it pained me, I left my book on the couch and retrieved my running shoes. 


        </p>
        <p>
            I clutched my necklace to my heart and sighed. I couldn’t wait to come home.


        </p>
